description: Let me tell you all about me
---

I'm a small, starting developer that mainly uses Java and Python.  
Together with some friends, I created Tywrap Studios, a development Studios that mainly creates Minecraft mods. 
### About me:
- Mostly interested in Modding Minecraft and playing it.
- Currently learning a lot of stuff related to Fabric(/Quilt) Modding and developing Discord Bots using discord.py.
  - I also want to start learning stuff like web development using HTML/CSS.  

### Reaching out to me:
- You can join Tywrap Studios' [Discord server](https://discord.gg/kcm8scfCwK) and open a ticket, anything works!  
- For private stuff you want to discuss one to one without witty Discord staff there, or if you don't feel like conversing through Discord at all, there's also the option of mailing [business@tiazzz.me](mailto:business@tiazzz.me) / [info.tywrap.studio@gmail.com](mailto:info.tywrap.studio@gmail.com)! (they all end up in the same inbox, so don't worry about which one to use)
