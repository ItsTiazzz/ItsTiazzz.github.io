title: New site!

I am in the most major love-hate relationship with Jekyll and how it made up the majority of my last site. Because of that, I decided to start fresh with a new site design that fits better what I imagined at first.

I'm still _using_ Jekyll for this blogging stuff, but the index/homepage is now a custom HTML page I made with Framer based on this [Waitlister Template](https://www.framer.com/marketplace/templates/waitlister/).
I also made a custom 404 page, which is a first for me. But I think it turned out VERY well. (I love putting random anime girls in my pages, and this one is no exception. I think it fits the vibe of the site very well.)

A shorter blog post I guess, but I do want to say I also plan on doing a Tywrap Studios site!
Any feedback on _this_ site is appreciated, and as always, you can just open an issue on the repo if you have any suggestions or feedback. 
I will be happy to take a look at it and see if I can implement it.

Have a good one!
