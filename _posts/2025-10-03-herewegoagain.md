So uh.

Yeah.

I kinda suck at sticking to a single thing. 

## I PROMISE THIS IS THE LAST TIME I CHANGE MY SITE!!
<br>
It's not that I didn't like the last site, it's just that the code was really hard to change due to the
fact that I was copying it from a hosted Framer site, and Framer does Framer stuff and for some reason
it generated an HTML file of 3000 lines which I am NOT going to edit by hand. I've used the portfolYOU theme
before for the [Tywrap Studios site](https://tywrap-studios.tiazzz.me/), and the [docs hub](https://docs.tiazzz.me),
so I had some familiarity with it, so I decided to use it again for this site.

Alongside that I added my own custom [Translation Projects page](../translation-projects) which I will be updating
from time to time as well.

No more anime girls though... Might have to fix that...
