    Copyright (c) Tywrap Studios; All Rights Reserved unless explicitly stated otherwise.

3. Contributions

    Any code contributions made to the software are purely voluntarily and you will grant us
    without any limitation the rights to use, copy, modify, merge, publish,
    distribute, sublicense, and/or sell copies of your contributed code, similar to the beforementioned MIT

    With any art contributions made to the software, you reserve all remaining rights to your contributed art,
    you grant only us limitless permission to use, modify, fork and/or publish and distribute your
    contributed art as part of the software.

4. Non-direct Contribution

    Any content added by non-direct contribution will have its respective license stay intact, even if the
    license specifies we may sub- and relicense the content. Said respective license will be included and/or
    properly specified within that part of the software and all rights will remain the same as normal.
    This goes for code, art and/or any other type of content.

    You are fully permitted to fork and copy over the code from any part of the software,
    unless explicitly stated otherwise. To be clear; this does not include any art, unless you hold
    part of the rights to it, or it is explicitly stated you may use it. If you make a hard fork of the
    software source, you are required to remove any of said art from your fork, whether it's for private or
    public use.

6. Revocation

    We reserve the right to revoke your access to the software in whatever way possible if we deem necessary.
    We will do this through non-malicious means, including but certainly not limited to using methods such as
    hard blacklists or requiring you to authenticate yourself in whatever way possible. If you hold rights
    to any part of the software, we will still continue to use that part if the beforementioned terms apply
    correctly. If not, your contribution, be it direct or not, will be removed from the software.

7. License Squared

    "You" refers to someone using/editing this license.

    You may use this license for any software. But if you modify any part of the license, you must make the
    user aware of this, either by changing the title by adding "Modified", and/or explicitly defining and
    explaining the modification at the place it was made. The only exception to this term is if you need to
    leave out parts of the "Code" and "Art" definitions and of course replacing the mock values in between
    "<>". Again, a copy of the raw, unedited license can be found at https://tiazzz.me/licensing/tyspal.
